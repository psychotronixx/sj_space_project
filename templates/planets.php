            <div class="acc_answer">
                <p>In our solar system, there are eight recognized planets: 
                    Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

            <button class="accordion">What defines a planet</button>
            <div class="acc_answer">
                <p>Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars, are massive enough 
                    for their gravity to form them into a nearly round shape, and have 
                    cleared their orbits of other debris.

            <button class="accordion">What are terrestrial and gas giant planets?</button>
            <div class="acc_answer">
                <p>Gas giants, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are primarily composed of hydrogen 
                    and helium and have no solid surface, featuring thick atmospheres and dense cores.

            <div class="acc_answer">
                <p>in the "habitable zone" of their stars, where conditions might support liquid waterâ€”a key 
                    ingredient for life as we know it. Some exoplanets have been identified as potential candidates 
                    for habitability, but further study is needed to determine their actual conditions.
